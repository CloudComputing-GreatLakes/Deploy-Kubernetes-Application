## Capstone Project- Deploy Kubernetes Application

You will use Amazon EKS to deploy a highly available Kubernetes control plane. You will then configure 'kubectl', an open source command line tool to interact with your Kubernetes infrastructure. Using AWS CloudFormation, you will launch a cluster of worker nodes on Amazon EC2, then launch a containerized guest book application onto your cluster.
